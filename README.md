# BSIA - Blood Sugar and Insulin use Analysis
## Personal motivation
* I'm a diabetic and couldn't find any app or computer program that fits my needs when it comes to blood glucose analysis;
* It's important that I'm able to generate reports which answer specific questions for me and my endo;
* I want to learn how to handle data using Python.

## Plans for the future
I plan on starting to analyse data from the CSV files that [Diaguard](https://github.com/Faltenreich/Diaguard) exports.

# Source for calculating HbA1c
The HbA1c estimative depends on the estimated average glucose (mg/dL) from the last three months, as described in:
Nathan DM, Kuenen J, Borg R, Zheng H, Schoenfeld D, Heine RJ (2008). **"Translating the A1C assay into estimated average glucose values"**. *Diabetes Care*. 31 (8): 1473â€“78.
